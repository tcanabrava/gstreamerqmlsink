The main idea is to use the GStreamer qmlsink directly on Qml

This is not happening yet - I have issues creating a QQuickItem that
actually handles the sink and is able to display the elements.

This is a "back from the beggining" as I deleted the old code when I
got into a position where nothign actually worked - at all

To compile this you need:
- Qt 5.12+
- GStreamer

*should* work in linux / windows / mac
